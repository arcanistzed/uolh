## 2026-08-17 - [Skip-to-content Layout Enhancements]
**Learning:** Implementing skip-to-content links often requires pairing them with a proper semantic `<main>` tag that has `tabindex="-1"` and `outline-none` so focus skips down securely without leaving confusing focus rings.
**Action:** Ensure all site wrappers have skip-to-content logic utilizing this `<main>` pairing rather than just skipping to generic `id` anchors.

## 2026-08-17 - [Unicode Symbol Accessibility]
**Learning:** Screen readers often read decorative unicode symbols (like ♥) literally (e.g., "black heart suit"), which can be confusing in context.
**Action:** Always wrap decorative or inline unicode symbols in a `<span role="img" aria-label="[description]">` to ensure proper screen reader accessibility instead of them being read literally.

## 2023-10-27 - Added active state to navigation links
**Learning:** The navigation menu previously lacked any visual or semantic indication of the current active page, violating WCAG principles for providing context and hindering general usability for sighted users.
**Action:** Implemented dynamic path checking to apply `aria-current="page"` to the active link. This allowed for semantic indication for screen readers and styling using Tailwind's `aria-[current=page]:` variant to provide clear visual feedback without custom CSS.

## 2026-09-09 - Focus Management and Mobile Menu Accessibility
**Learning:** In Astro components using standard DOM scripts (like `<script>` blocks), focus rings bound to `focus:` utilities in Tailwind CSS penalize mouse users. Additionally, closing native `<details>` or custom dropdowns via keyboard needs explicit programmatic focus restoration to prevent screen readers from losing context.
**Action:** Always prefer `focus-visible:` for interactive elements over `focus:` to maintain visual aesthetics for mouse users while keeping a11y for keyboard users. When building custom toggles (e.g. mobile menus), ensure that pressing `Escape` triggers `.focus()` back on the toggle button element.
